This document consists of Web Track tasks that will help you to begin your journey in the programming world and move one step ahead to be part of Team TechnoJam.

 Submission Guidelines

Create a GitHub repository with the name ‘technojam-task’. 
Make a folder for the respective task with the name task_#, where # is a task number. Each task must consist of a README.md file where you have to describe how you approached the task and the difficulty you have faced while solving the task. 
Only submissions made through the GitHub will be considered. 
After completing all the above steps, fill out this form.
Example Submission Repository: https://github.com/ayush0x00/technojam-task

Refer to the below table to know the minimum points/criteria required to get qualified for the next round based on the year you are currently in. The further selection will be made on a percentile basis (the more tasks you’ll solve, the better will be the chances of you getting selected). Selected students will be notified via email.

Make sure you don't get sidetracked into learning a whole language/ framework/ tech-stack for completing a task. You only have to learn the necessary things which are required to complete the task. 

Also directly copying and pasting code will make that submission invalid, and no points will be counted. The last date for task submission is 10th December 2021, which can be extended in case of clashes with ETE.
