Well first of all thanks to all for giving this task to us.  For me creating a portfolio website is a pretty decent task, my approach in building this website was focused
 1. website should be clean 
 2. Responsive 

problems I faced:: 
I didn't use javascript frequently but on this website, I first learned how to animate buttons then I applied it to website
2. I learned how to use dropdown buttons.
